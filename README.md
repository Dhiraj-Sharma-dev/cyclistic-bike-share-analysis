# 🚲 Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes bike-share usage data from a fictional company called **Cyclistic**.  
The main goal is to understand how **casual riders** and **annual members** use bikes differently, and how these insights can help the business convert more casual riders into paid members.

This project was completed as part of my **Google Data Analytics Certificate**, using real-world data analysis practices.
